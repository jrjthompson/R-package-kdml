Description: Distance metrics between mixed-type observations consisting of numeric (continuous), factor (nominal), and ordered factor (ordinal) variables. This methodology utilizes additive and product mixed-type kernels to calculate metrics that are flexible for any mixed-type dataset. Bandwidths associated with each kernel function are selected via Maximum Similarity Cross-validation. These methods return a distance matrix and are designed for distance-based clustering, but can be tuned for any algorithm requiring a distance matrix.
